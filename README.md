My objection is to 

-- 1. How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior? -- 

-- 2. How are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods? -- 

-- 3. Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers? -- 

-- 4. What are the relationships between age, spending, and product preferences? -- 

-- 5. How do customers adapt their shopping habits during seasonal trends? --

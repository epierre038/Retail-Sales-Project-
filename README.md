4. -- Executive summary --

This analysis explores customer purchasing behavior based on age, gender, time periods, and product preferences using sales data from 2023.

1. Gender and Age Influence on Purchasing Behavior
Customer purchasing habits vary significantly by both gender and age. Males around the age of 40 tend to spend more on electronics, whereas females of the same average age show a stronger preference for clothing.

2. Sales Patterns Across Time Periods
Sales trends throughout 2023 reveal noticeable quarterly shifts in product category performance:

Q1: Clothing led in sales, generating approximately $46,000.

Q2: Electronics outperformed other categories, also reaching $46,000.

Q3: No category surpassed $40,000, though electronics still led overall.

Q4: Electronics rebounded strongly, achieving the year's highest quarterly total of $48,000.

3. Most Appealing Product Categories
Across both genders, three main product categories—beauty, clothing, and electronics—show varied appeal:

Clothing is most popular among females, with total sales of $81,000.

Electronics are the top choice for males, with sales close behind at $80,000.

Beauty products are also highly favored by females, bringing in $74,000.

4. Age, Spending, and Product Preferences
Certain age groups are higher spenders:

Ages 19, 34, 43, and 51 each spent over $15,000.

Conversely, individuals aged 24, 32, 39, 41, and 49 spent notably less, averaging around $5,000 or below.
This suggests that purchasing power and preferences vary notably by age, with peaks around early adulthood and middle age.
